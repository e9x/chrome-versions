Database of Chrome builds and Chrome OS recovery images hosted by Google.

> Currently, only Chrome OS is being worked on.

## Database

Complete databases can be found in the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-versions). These databases are produced on high-end workstations (16 GB memory, low latency connection to [dl.google.com](https://dl.google.com/)), however you should be able to produce them on your own machine.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/e9x/chrome-versions/wiki) for information (quickstart, how this works).
